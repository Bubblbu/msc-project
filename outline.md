## Introduction

## Theory

### Critical Neuroscience

Introduction to the concept of Critical Neuroscience and some of their main criticism.

- Emphasis of the social and cultural aspects of neuroscience.
- Reductionism
- Power Dynamics
- First-Order and Second-Order feedback loops of scientists investigating the brain (reminiscent of Hacking's looping effects)

### What is Reductionism?

What are neuroscientists usually referring to when they mention reductionism?
Are these concepts similar to those that philosophers have been debating for many years?

Reductionism is mentioned several times as problematic development of the _neurohype_ by the authors of Critical Neuroscience, e.g., _greedy reductionism_ () as a negative term that describes reductionism as a negative aspect, _radical reductionism_ (Buckle) on the other hand describes a reductionist attitude criticised by others.

This chapter briefly visits the history and philosophy of science in the context of reductionism in the life sciences.

- Ontological Reductionism
- Methodological Reductionism
- Epistemological Reductionism

Furthermore, keep track of reoccurring terminology that has been introduced in the literature and might or might not be used synonymously with _reductionism_ and create a annotated glossary of "reductionisms".

## Methodology

### Sample

Difficult to find a sample as reductionist ideas and practices will often not be identified and tagged as such.

Two different approaches:

Reductionist Papers
: Ten neuroscientific articles that have been identified as problematic examples of reductionist practices within neuroscience.

Popular Papers
: Identify the ten most popular neuroscientific articles by amount of news coverage (data source: Altmetric.com).
