## Abstract (WIP)

Critical neuroscience, a recent movement started by a group of interdisciplinary scholars around [Chudhoury and Slaby (2012)](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/772658635) is calling a more critical attitude in the neurosciences. One of the fundamental pillars of the critique is an increasingly unquestioned commitment to the reductionist program. Similar to the Gestaltists in the 1910s in Germany who proposed a holistic approach to psychology ([Koffka, 2013](http://worldcat.org/oclc/931550)), or as systems biology does for medicine ([Ahn, Tewari, Poon, & Phillips, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1371/JOURNAL.PMED.0030208)), critical neuroscience tries to emphasise a holistic and interdisciplinary program for cognitive neuroscience. But what is reductionism? The term is used widely in everyday life, philosophy, and obviously across all of the sciences and humanities. Especially the academic use of reductionism is often vague in its meaning. Using a discourse analysis I propose to address this difficulty and uncover reductionist discourses within neuroscientific literature. The analysed texts consist of scholarly publications within the broader field of cognitive neuroscience that may cover foundational research within neuroscience, molecular neurobiology, as well as research in psychology that relies on neuroscientific methods and have been identified as problematic by authors committed to the critical neuroscientific programme. The results may reveal how reductionism expresses itself within the text as well as beyond the limits of the written word.
